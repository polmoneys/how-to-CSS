## TLDR

Play with it on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/demo-how-to-css-n0pzeq).

## Getting started

Write CSS on any folder structure and import all files to **index.css**. A file **styles.css** will be created in **/out** directory. 

```bash

   npm run css
   
   # also available
   npm run critical

```

Picked tokens (check **postcss.config.cjs**) will be exported as **css-tokens.js** in root folder so that you can consume them with **js**.

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible: 
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that 
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or 
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to fullfill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic 
> enjoyment from observing them in use. 

Erik Gunnar Asplund on **Swedish Grace**.
